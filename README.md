6. Themes
7. Playlists
8. Images
9. Using remotely - server & remote
10. Caching?
11. Easy support for creating own themes
12. Change the time in the current song
13. Addon support

14. Add ability to add image ! WILL WRITE TO THAT FILE THEN
15. Full screen mode
16. lazy loading
17. Add a queue system
18. Audio spectrum
