WIP

Lots to fix up

TODO:

1. I think there's some over lap of 'npm i'. Pretty sure react-scripts is in both, probably much more
2. cleanup react-app, lots of unused stuff
3. implement testing
4. Watch the library directory for file changes so we don't need a manual refresh
5. Themes
6. Using remotely - server & remote
7. Caching?
8. Easy support for creating own themes
9. Addon support
   - Lyrics
   - Themes?
   - Youtube?
10. Add ability to add image ! WILL WRITE TO THAT FILE THEN
11. lazy loading
12. Add a queue system
13. Cleanup packages, I know wave-encoder is not used
14. Need to export to mp3, rn, exporting to WAV is creating audio files x10 as big as their original
15. Shuffle
16. Resturcture styles, does creating all of these extra folders take up a lot of storage??
